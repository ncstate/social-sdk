Getting Started
==================

Start by dropping the files into your project. You might choose a directory called `/includes` in the root of your site for example.

##Dependencies

We highly recommend you use Composer to load dependencies. You may choose to load the dependencies some other way, but those methods will not be covered here.

The official documentation for installing Composer can be found [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx), but below is a TL;DR version for those on Linux/Unix/OSX. (Sorry Windows, no shortcuts here.)

Assuming you have cURL and PHP installed, run the following from inside your `/ncstate-social-sdk` directory.

```
// Installs Composer into ncstate-social-sdk/bin directory
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=bin

// Excecutes dependency installation to ncstate-social-sdk/vendor
$ php bin/composer.phar install
```

If you have installed Composer globally for this or any other project, you can just run
```
$ composer install
```

##Configuration

Now that you have all the dependencies installed, you can set your configuration. Copy the contents of `config-sample.php` to a file called 'config.php' and edit the contents according to the instructions. Here is a quick list of what you might need.

###Facebook
* App ID
* App Secret

###Twitter
* Consumer Key
* Consumer Secret
* Oauth Token
* Oauth Token Secret

###Instagram
* Instagram App Key

Lastly, just include the following in whatever files need to access to social networks.
```php
require 'PATH_TO_FILE/ncstate-social-sdk.php';
```

##Functions

                        into the area, it names NC State and its solution-driven research as a 
                        major reason.",
